Defined: A common, standardized risk framework is adopted across the organization.

Integrated: Risk management is integrated into business processes, and metrics are used to measure effectiveness.

Optimized: Risk management focuses on achieving strategic objectives, and lessons learned are used for continuous improvement.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 1.9.9
What are the 7 steps of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)?

Back:

Prepare: Establish a context for managing risk.

Categorize: Classify the system and its information based on the impact of loss.

Select: Choose an initial set of controls for the system.

Implement: Put the selected controls in place.
