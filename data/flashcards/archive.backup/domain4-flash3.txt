### **Domain 4.1.7 – Performance Metrics**

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.7*
What is the difference between **bandwidth** and **throughput**?

**Back:**

* **Bandwidth**: Theoretical maximum data transfer rate over a network in a given time.
* **Throughput**: Actual data transfer rate achieved.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.7*
What is **latency** and how is it measured?

**Back:**
The time it takes for data to travel from source to destination and back (round trip), measured in milliseconds.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.7*
What is **jitter** in networking?

**Back:**
Variation in packet delay times; measured in milliseconds. Low jitter is important for real-time applications.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.7*
What does **SNR** stand for and why is it important?

**Back:**
**Signal-to-Noise Ratio** — measures signal quality compared to background noise. Higher SNR allows higher data rates.

### **Domain 4.1.8 – Traffic Flows**

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.8*
What is **north-south traffic** in a data center?

**Back:**
Traffic flowing into and out of the data center between external clients and internal servers.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.8*
What is **east-west traffic** in a data center?

**Back:**
Traffic moving laterally between servers, storage systems, and applications inside the data center or between connected data centers.

---

### **Domain 4.1.9 – Physical Segmentation**

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.9*
What is the difference between **in-band** and **out-of-band** management?

**Back:**

* **In-band**: Management traffic shares the same network as production traffic.
* **Out-of-band**: Management uses a dedicated, separate network.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.9*
What is **air gapping**?

**Back:**
Physically isolating a system or network from all other networks, including the internet, for security purposes.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.9*
What is the difference between **physical segmentation** and **logical segmentation**?

**Back:**

* **Physical segmentation**: Uses separate physical hardware or cabling to isolate networks.
* **Logical segmentation**: Uses VLANs, subnets, or software-based controls to isolate traffic on shared infrastructure.

### **Domain 4.1.10 – Network Separation**

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.10*
What is the purpose of **network separation**?

**Back:**
To isolate systems or networks with different security requirements, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data leakage between them.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.10*
What are common methods for implementing network separation?

**Back:**

* Physical separation (air-gapped networks)
* VLANs and subnets
* Firewalls between segments

### **Domain 4.1.11 – Wireless Networks**

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.11*
What security protocol replaced WEP for wireless encryption and why?

**Back:**
**WPA2** replaced WEP due to WEP’s weak key management and encryption flaws; WPA2 uses AES-based CCMP for stronger security.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.11*
What is the difference between **WPA2-Personal** and **WPA2-Enterprise**?

**Back:**

* **WPA2-Personal**: Uses a pre-shared key (PSK).
* **WPA2-Enterprise**: Uses 802.1X authentication with a RADIUS server.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.11*
What is **MAC filtering** in wireless networks?

**Back:**
A method of allowing or denying network access based on device MAC addresses; offers weak security as MAC addresses can be spoofed.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.11*
What is a **deauthentication attack**?

**Back:**
A Wi-Fi DoS attack that sends spoofed management frames to disconnect clients from an access point.

---

---

### **Domain 4.1.12 – Load Balancing & Resiliency**

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.12*
What is the purpose of **load balancing**?

**Back:**
To distribute network traffic across multiple servers or links for optimized performance, availability, and fault tolerance.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.12*
What is the difference between **stateful** and **stateless** load balancing?

**Back:**

* **Stateful**: Maintains session information, ensuring client requests return to the same server.
* **Stateless**: Routes each request independently, without tracking session state.

---

---

### **Domain 4.1.13 – Firewalls & Proxies**

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.13*
What is a **stateful firewall**?

**Back:**
A firewall that tracks active connections and makes filtering decisions based on connection state as well as rules.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.13*
What is the difference between a **proxy** and a **reverse proxy**?

**Back:**

* **Proxy**: Forwards client requests to external servers, hiding the client’s identity.
* **Reverse proxy**: Forwards requests from external clients to internal servers, hiding the servers.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.13*
What is a **DMZ** (Demilitarized Zone)?

**Back:**
A network segment that separates an organization’s internal network from the public internet, hosting systems that require external access while protecting the internal network.
