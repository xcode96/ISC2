**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.3*

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.3*
What are the two main protocols in **IPSec** and their purposes?

**Back:**

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.5*
What is **Voice over IP (VoIP)** and how is it secured?

**Back:**
Encapsulates audio/video into IP packets for calls and collaboration; typically secured with **SIPS** (signaling) and **SRTP** (media).

---

---

### **Domain 4.1.6 – Transport Architecture**

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.6*
What are the three planes in network architecture and their purposes?

**Back:**

* **Data plane**: Forwards packets (the “do-er”).
* **Control plane**: Determines paths and routes (the “planner”).
* **Management plane**: Configures and monitors the network (the “administrator”).

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.6*
What is the difference between **cut-through** and **store-and-forward** switching?

**Back:**

* **Cut-through**: Forwards a frame as soon as the destination address is read; low latency but no full error check.
* **Store-and-forward**: Receives the entire frame, checks for errors, then forwards; higher latency but more reliable.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.6*
What is the difference between a **physical** and **logical** topology?

**Back:**

* **Physical topology**: Actual layout of cables and devices.
* **Logical topology**: How data flows through the network, regardless of physical connections.

### **Domain 4.1.14 – VPNs**

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.14*
What is the difference between a **site-to-site VPN** and a **remote access VPN**?

**Back:**

* **Site-to-site VPN**: Connects entire networks (e.g., branch office to HQ).
* **Remote access VPN**: Connects individual clients to a network over the internet.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.14*
What is the difference between **SSL VPN** and **IPSec VPN**?

**Back:**

* **SSL VPN**: Uses SSL/TLS for encryption, typically over a web browser.
* **IPSec VPN**: Uses IPSec protocols (AH/ESP) for encryption and authentication, often at the OS/network layer.

---

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.14*
What is **split tunneling** in VPNs and why is it risky?

**Back:**
A configuration allowing a VPN user to access both the corporate network and the internet directly at the same time; risk: traffic can bypass security controls, creating exposure.

### **Domain 4.1.15 – Network Monitoring**

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 4.1.15*
What is the difference between **NIDS** and **HIDS**?

**Back:**

* **NIDS**: Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity; not visible to attackers on the network.
