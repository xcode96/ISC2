Domain 5.1 – Control Physical and Logical Access to Assets

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.1
What does controlling physical and logical access to information involve?

Back:
Implementing security measures to ensure only authorized individuals can view, modify, or manage information, using access controls, encryption, and data classification.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.1
How is physical and logical access controlled for systems?

Back:
By enforcing authentication, role-based permissions, and physical security measures such as locked server rooms and tamper detection.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.1
How is access to devices controlled?

Back:
Through device authentication, endpoint security, asset tagging, and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized removal or use.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.1
How is access to facilities managed?

Back:
Via physical controls like security guards, card readers, biometric scanners, CCTV monitoring, and visitor management systems.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.1
How is access to applications controlled?

Back:
Using application-level authentication, role-based access, input validation, and secure coding practices.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.1
How is access to services restricted?

Back:
By limiting service accounts, securing APIs, applying firewall rules, and using identity-based access controls.

Domain 5.2 – Design Identification and Authentication Strategy

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.2
What is the role of groups in identification and authentication?

Back:
Groups simplify access management by assigning permissions collectively, ensuring consistent and scalable privilege assignments.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.2
How are roles used in authentication strategies?

Back:
Roles define access rights based on job functions, enabling easier permission management and principle of least privilege.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.2
What is AAA in security?

Back:
Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting — a framework for validating users, determining privileges, and tracking activity.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.2
What is MFA and why is it important?

Back:
Multi-Factor Authentication requires two or more authentication factors (something you know, have, or are) to increase security.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.2
What is passwordless authentication?

Back:
An authentication method that replaces passwords with alternatives such as biometrics, security keys, or magic links.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.2
What is session management and why is it important?

Back:
The practice of controlling how user sessions are created, maintained, and terminated to prevent hijacking and unauthorized access.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.2
What is identity proofing?

Back:
The process of verifying that a claimed identity corresponds to a real person, often via government ID checks or third-party services.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.2
What is FIM in authentication strategy?

Back:
Federated Identity Management — allows a user’s authentication to be trusted across multiple systems and organizations.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.2
What is credential management?

Back:
The secure creation, storage, rotation, and revocation of user credentials to prevent compromise.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.2
What is SSO and how does it improve authentication?

Back:
Single Sign-On allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple systems without re-entering credentials, reducing password fatigue.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.2
What is Just-In-Time access and why use it?

Back:
A security model where elevated privileges are granted only when needed and for a limited time, reducing the attack surface.

Domain 5.3 – Federated Identity with a Third-Party Service

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.3
What is an on-premise federated identity?

Back:
Federated authentication managed entirely within an organization’s local infrastructure, without relying on external services.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.3
What is cloud-based federated identity?

Back:
Authentication services hosted and managed by a cloud provider, enabling SSO and identity management across cloud apps.

Front:
Domain/Subdomain: 5.3
What is hybrid federated identity?

Back:
A mix of on-premise and cloud-based identity systems, allowing flexibility and gradual migration.
