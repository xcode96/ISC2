***

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 3.1.6*
What is **Separation of Duties (SoD)**?

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 3.1.8*
What is the core principle of **Zero Trust**?

**Back:**
It's a security concept based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." It assumes that no user or device is automatically trusted, and every access request must be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted before access is granted.

***

**Front:**
*Domain/Subdomain: 3.1.9*
What are the 7 principles of **Privacy by Design (PbD)**?

**Back:**
1.  **Proactive, not reactive; preventative, not remedial**
